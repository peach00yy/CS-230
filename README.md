1. The Gaming Room is requesting a web-based version of the game Draw it or Lose it, a game that allows teams of players to view images from a library of stock images and use those images as clues to solve a puzzle.
The games requirements are as list: 
•	A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
•	Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
•	Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
•	Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

2. I believe i did a good job of tracking and documenting the changes made to the document, allowing anyone else who needed to review and or work on the document a clear understanding of what was currently being worked on and what has been completed. 

3. The design document makes developing code very simple, once you complete the design document you have full understanding of what is required and how you plan to accomplish the requirements. You are never let wondering what's next while developing the code.

4. I would revise my recommendations and include more hard facts and numbers to support my points rather than what i think and feel. 

5.The user's needs are crucial during development they provide us with a guideline of what to code and how the application should operate, using the information given to me by the company's requirements and their listed user needs I was able to implement them into the code. 

6. I created a plan supported by the information presented to me from the Gaming room and made sure to meet all of there requirements and user needs.
